## 🧠 Development Standards

- **Security First:** Secrets and environment configs are stored locally and excluded via `.gitignore`.
- **Consistency:** Shared code patterns, PHP 8+ standards, and modular app design.
- **Documentation:** Each project includes a `README.md` with setup and usage info.
- **Automation:** Integrated scripts and tools reduce manual processes across departments.
